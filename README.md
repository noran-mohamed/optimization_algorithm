# Optimization Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of optimization algorithms applied to two different tasks:

1. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Hill Climbing**  
   - Find the shortest route visiting all cities exactly once.
   - Input: Adjacency matrix of pairwise distances between cities.

2. **Rastrigin Function Visualization**  
   - A benchmark optimization function used to test algorithms.
   - Visualized using surface and contour plots.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
