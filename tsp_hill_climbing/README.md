# Traveling Salesman Problem with Hill Climbing

This script solves the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using the **Hill Climbing algorithm**.

## How It Works
- Generate a random adjacency matrix for 20 cities.
- Start with a random route (permutation of cities).
- Iteratively improve by swapping cities until no better solution is found.

## Run
```bash
python tsp_hill_climbing.py
